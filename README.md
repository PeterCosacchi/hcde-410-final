# hcde-410-final
My final project for HCDE 410 at the University of Washington

I want to analyze the demographics vs. credit card consumer information to predict behaviours in certain clients. I want to determine if any demographic variable has a discernable impact on how a client behaves in purchasing/maintaining a credit card.
